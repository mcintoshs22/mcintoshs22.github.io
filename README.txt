This software has two features. On the main page a user can input a plaintext or ciphertext 
message along with a keyword and key letter. There are buttons to encipher or decipher the 
user's input and display the output. On the "cryptanalysis" page, the user can input 
ciphertext without knowing the keyword or key letter. The user can then fill in letter 
guesses in the cipher alphabet and the software makes the letter substitutions in the output. 
This allows users to determine the keyword and key letter used to encipher the ciphertext.
